    {"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" SkiX SkiX, the SkiFree Game Doc Play online - Demo npm install npm run dev Code challenge This project is a answer to the following code challenge: Ceros Ski Code Challenge Changes made after the fork: BUG FIX After get crashed when hitting an obstacle, the skier should be able to get and be facing to the left side up after pressing the left arrow. BUG FIX There was a bug when starting the game and imediately calling ObstacleManager.placeNewObstacle() method. There were no conditionals checking the value of the variable previousGameWindow. BUILD IMPROVEMENTS The babel and wepack setup was update to use newer versions. Allowing, for example, the usage of private resources inside Classes. Security issues related to modules being used is also now solved. Added source maps to improve debugging. Added Eslint to enforce best pratices and code quality. jsDoc setup to generate documentation based on comments from source files. Refactor Skier: The property Skier.assetName is moved to Entity class to be able to be used by any class extending the Entity class. Game: TESTING Deprecated Jest in favor of Cypress to get a real browser environment to test the game. Jest setup would need at least one addon to deal with canvas and you still does not have a real browser environment. This change is now allowing visual testing. Written unit tests to cover initial reported issue. Written unit tests to cover the jump funcionality. The test suite now is now able to be run as unit test and visual testing and unit test mode.
