Allowing, for example, the usage of private resources inside Classes. Security issues related to modules being used is also now solved. Added source maps to improve debugging. Added Eslint to enforce best pratices and code quality. jsDoc setup to generate documentation based on comments from source files. BUG FIX After get crashed when hitting an obstacle, the skier should be able to get and be facing to the left side up after pressing the left arrow. BUG FIX There was a bug when starting the game and imediately calling ObstacleManager.placeNewObstacle() method. There were no conditionals checking the value of the variable previousGameWindow. REFACTOR Skier: The property Skier.assetName is moved to Entity class to be able to be used by any class extending the Entity class. Game: FEATURE The skier is now able to jump when pressing the shift key. It original speed is incresed to two times. When jumping the skier does not get crashed if it hit any rock obstacle. FEATURE The Ramp Jump obstacle is now implemented. When hitting the ramp jump the skier behaves like it's jumping. TESTING Deprecated Jest in favor of Cypress to get a real browser environment to test the game. Jest setup would need at least one addon to deal with canvas and you still does not have a real browser environment. This change is now allowing visual testing. Written unit tests to cover initial reported issue. Written unit tests to cover the jump funcionality. The test suite now is now able to be run as unit test and visual testing and unit test mode. REFACTOR The image assets were encoded into base64 strings and stored as js modules and now are they are built and loaded together with the main and unique bundle file. This is a change which improves the game loading and make it easiest to update any asset FEATURE The rhino is up and hungry! Rhino runs from right to left based in skier currently position Ã— Search results Close "}}
